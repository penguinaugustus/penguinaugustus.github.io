Welcome to **Freddie (Yu) Fu**'s academic page. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign double majoring in [Physics](https://physics.illinois.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.illinois.edu/), and minoring in [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/). 
Before that, I was an undergraduate student at Fudan University(2020-2022), majoring in Physics and Computer Science.


Research Interest
======

After poking around in many subfields of physics(i.e., high energy Phenomenology, astrophysics, biological physics, and soft condensed matter) and a field outside of physics(cognitive neural science), my research interests have now converged on biological physics and soft condensed matter. I am interested in both theory and computation. I am currently advised by Prof. [Sergei Maslov](https://maslov.bioengineering.illinois.edu/), Prof. [Antonia Statt](https://statt.matse.illinois.edu/), and Prof. [Ido Golding](https://bacteriophysics.web.illinois.edu/) at UIUC. If you are interested in my research experience, please visit the "Projects" section to learn more about my academic odyssey during undergraduate studies.
