Pathological anxiety is among the major mental health issues in adolescence. It is well-documented that, working memory, a core cognitive function, is often disrupted in anxiety. However, the computational mechanisms of working memory deficits in adolescents with anxiety remain elusive. Here, we used the classical delay-estimation task in basic science to assess the visual working memory performance of adolescents with anxiety disorder (N = 39) versus health controls (N = 41). Taking a computational psychiatry approach, we tested 14 models established in basic research of visual working memory (VWM). Model comparison results identified the variableprecision model as the best-fitting model for both groups, indicating that the two groups share a qualitatively similar VWM process in completing the task. Subsequent analyses of the parameter estimates pointed to atypically reduced memory resources as the major determinant of impaired VWM performance in adolescents with anxiety disorder. Crucially, estimated memory resources in the anxiety group predicted the severity of anxiety symptoms. Using state-of-the-art computational modeling, our results reveal that shrunk memory source is the key factor mediating working memory deficits in adolescents with anxiety disorder, and this factor may also serve as a potential behavioral marker for future clinical interventions. The current study also highlights the use of computational approaches in dissecting the hidden mechanisms of psychiatric conditions.
