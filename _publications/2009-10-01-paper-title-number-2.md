In bacteria, while the connection between a gene's regulatory architecture and its expression is well-established in the context of individual model gene circuits, a genome-scale perspective of such connection is lacking. A recent collaborative project from our lab aimed to develop a genome-wide classification of transcriptional regulation based on the response of each gene to its own replication. However, some genes exhibit transcriptional behavior that falls outside the current theoretical framework. Meanwhile, many data-driven machine learning algorithms aimed to construct ordinary differential equation models have emerged in recent years. These algorithms may be helpful in discovering hidden regulatory mechanisms beyond the current model. In this work, we aim to use machine learning-aided methods to perform a genome-wide classification of transcriptional behavior based on real Escherichia coli (E.) coli data. After considering several different algorithms, we now focus on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, which is more practical due to its high computational efficiency. We reported some simple test cases of remarkable agreement between the simulation data generated from the mRNA transcription model and the ODE model learned by SINDy. We anticipate that our attempt will serve as a starting point for learning more complicated transcriptional regulation models using data-driven methods.
