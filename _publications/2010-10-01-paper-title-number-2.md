title: "Top-Quark Effective Field Theory"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This is the term paper of a graduate level particle physics with Prof.Jiayin Gu. This essay is mainly based on Cen Zhang and Scott Willenbrock’s work in 2010. It employs effective field theory to dimension six to describe process in top-quark physics such as top-quark decay and top-quark production. Effective field theory is believed to be simpler and better at describing BSM phenomena compaired with traditional vertex function approach.'

This term paper was completed as a component of graduate-level particle physics coursework under the supervision of Prof. [Jiayin Gu](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1274618). Although my interests have since transitioned from particle physics to biophysics and soft matter, I sincerely value Prof. Gu’s instruction and encouragement. His guidance has instilled in me the confidence to advance my academic career.
