This is the term paper of a graduate level particle physics with Prof. [Jiayin Gu](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1274618). Though my interest now shifts from particle physics to biophysics and soft matter, I really appreciate Prof. Gu's instruction and encouragement to me, which give me confidence to further my career in academia.
