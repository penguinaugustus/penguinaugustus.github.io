title: "Top Quark Effective Field Theory"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This term paper was completed as part of graduate-level particle physics coursework under the supervision of Prof. Jiayin Gu. The essay primarily builds upon the work of Cen Zhang and Scott Willenbrock from 2010. It utilizes effective field theory up to dimension six to describe processes in top-quark physics, such as top-quark decay and top-quark production. Compared to the traditional vertex function approach, effective field theory is considered to be more straightforward and more apt for describing Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) phenomena.'

This term paper was completed as a component of graduate-level particle physics coursework under the supervision of Prof. [Jiayin Gu](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1274618). Although my interests have since transitioned from particle physics to biophysics and soft matter, I sincerely value Prof. Guâ€™s instruction and encouragement. His guidance has instilled in me the confidence to advance my academic career.
