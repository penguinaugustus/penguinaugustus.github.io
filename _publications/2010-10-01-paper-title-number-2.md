excerpt: 'This is the term paper of a graduate level particle physics with Prof. [Jiayin Gu](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1274618). Though my interest now shifts from particle physics to biophysics and soft matter, I really appreciate Prof. Gu's instruction and encouragement to me, which give me confidence to further my career in academia.'

This essay is mainly based on Cen Zhang and Scott Willenbrockâ€™s work in 2010. It employs effective field theory to dimension six to describe process in top-quark physics such as top-quark decay and top-quark production. Effective field theory is believed to be simpler and better at describing BSM phenomena compaired with traditional vertex function approach.
