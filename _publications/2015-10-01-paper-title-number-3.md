title: "Discussion on Two Kinds of Discrete Time Crystal"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3

excerpt: 'The spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry in periodically driven system leads to
discrete time crystal (DTC). The discrete time crystal can be divided into two cases, quantum time
crystal and classical time crystal. In this work, we explore the existence and properties of these two
kinds of time crystal. In quantum case, we work out a time crystal phase and give critical exponents
ν = 1.53 and β = 0.28 by numerical simulation. In classical case, the true long-range order discrete
time crystal phase only exists in the 3D system while thermal noise will melt the crystalline order
in 1D and 2D system. Our findings categorize both forms of discrete time crystals under the Ising class.
