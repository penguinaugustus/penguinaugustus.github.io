This note is written in Chinese and based on the undergrad-level statmech course I took in 22' spring with Professor [Xiaopeng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p7i5fNoAAAAJ&hl=en). I enjoyed this course so much and this is one clue that I finally gained interest in soft condense matter. The note has four chapter and here is the second chapter:  Ensemble Theory.
